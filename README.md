Will ask an LLM regarding the What, Why, How and When of the various functions, 
classes, logic, etc., etc. in the tutorial.

The purpose is to be able to make informed or intuit

Will serve as a pre-cursor/starting point for my libraryApp project, my CS50's final project.

Read DEVLOG.md for personal thoughts throughout the mini-learning-journey.
