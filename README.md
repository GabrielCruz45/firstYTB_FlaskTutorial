# firstYTB_FlaskTutorial
Following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA

Will ask an LLM regarding the What, Why, How and When of the various functions, 
classes, logic, etc., etc. in the tutorial.

The purpose is to be able to make informed or intuit 
high-level decisions when starting, configuring and creating a Flask project

Will serve as a pre-cursor/starting point for my libraryApp project



Some functionalities used on the tutorial are deprecated, tutorial is from 2019. (2025 rn)
I am currently (June 9) using LLM heavily to understand how to setup the application with app size in mind (lots of routes, tables etc.). Will help me a lot with the libraryApp project.
