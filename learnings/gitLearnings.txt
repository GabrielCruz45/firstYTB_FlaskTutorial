Initialize, stage, first commit on local and push to remote Repository


    Initialize local Repository
        git init

    Add your files to the staging area
        git add .

    Commit the staged files
        git commit -m "Initial commit"


    Connects your local repo to the remote one on GitHub
        git remote add origin <YOUR_REMOTE_URL>

    (Optional but good practice) Renames your main branch to 'main'
        git branch -M main

    Pushes your 'main' branch to the remote 'origin' and sets it as the default
        git push -u origin main



Branches
    
    Creates new branch, changes you to it
        git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>


    Set ups a tracking relationship bewteen your local branch and the new remote branch.
    After you can run ' git push ' and ' git pull ' without specifying the branch name again
        git add .
        git commit -m ""
        git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>


    Verifies your current branch (current branch will be marked with a *)
        git branch


    To switch to an existing branch
        git checkout <branch-name>

        or

        git checkout <remote-branch-name>

    ** Note on switching: 
        Make sure you have saved all your work before switching! ' git add .; git commit -m "" '
        If you are not ready to commit, stash your changes ' git stash '

        When you return to the original branch (where you left), you can reapply your stashed changes
        ' git stash pop '






to merge branches


push all the final changes to the separate branch (not main)
    git add .
    git commit -m "final changes to separate branch; etc."
    git push


change branches to merged into branch
    git checkout main


pull latest changes form your remote repository like GitHub
    git pull origin main


run the merge command
    git merge <separate branch's name>


push the merged branch
    git push origin main



To check for successful merge
    git log --oneline --graph
    q (to escape after)
