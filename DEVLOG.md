    Some functionalities used on the tutorial are deprecated, tutorial is from 2019.
I am currently using LLM heavily to understand how to setup the application with app size in mind (lots of routes, tables etc.). Will help me a lot with the libraryApp project.

    Used an LLM to help me further understand the functionalities of the app.py script, line by line. Asked it for next steps, told me to:

                    1. Refactor project structure (with the intent of practicing a scalable project structure)
                    2. Implementing CRUD functionality.
                    3. Learn database migrations. 
                    4. Add user authentication.

Depending on how the tutorial flows, I will add these features after completing the "tutorial" app.
