        git commit -m ""
        git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>


    Verifies your current branch (current branch will be marked with a *)
        git branch


    To switch to an existing branch
        git checkout <branch-name>

        or

        git checkout <remote-branch-name>

    ** Note on switching: 
        Make sure you have saved all your work before switching! ' git add .; git commit -m "" '
        If you are not ready to commit, stash your changes ' git stash '

        When you return to the original branch (where you left), you can reapply your stashed changes
        ' git stash pop '
