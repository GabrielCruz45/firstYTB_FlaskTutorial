Step 3: Initialize the Migration Repository



This is a one-time command. Run it in your terminal from the root directory of your project.
    
    Bash

    flask db init


This command creates a new migrations folder in your project. This is where Flask-Migrate will store all the scripts that track changes to your database schema.

                        *If you changed app.py to other:
                            
                            Bash

                            export FLASK_APP=run.py
                            flask db init



Step 4: Generate and Apply Migrations



This is the workflow you will follow whenever you change your models.



Generate a new migration: After changing a model in models.py, run this command.
    
    Bash

    flask db migrate -m "A short message describing your changes"



Apply the migration: This command runs the script generated above to update your database.
    
    Bash

    flask db upgrade
